## Auto-Update üîÑ

Starting with version 4.1.0, the long awaited auto-update functionality is now working!
It pulls from the [latest release](https://github.com/ewrogers/SleepHunter4/releases) section.

This means you can update from within the SleepHunter application itself by going to `Settings->Updates`.
If there is a new version available, you can update to it which will download, install, and restart SleepHunter.

**NOTE**: Your user settings **will be preserved**, but all other existing data files will be overwritten.

## Contributing üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

I am always accepting of pull requests (PRs) against this repository for additional features, bug fixes, and enhancements.
Now that Auto-Update is functional, it should be much easier to distribute these changes to users of the application.

It is recommended that you use [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/0) for developing on Windows.
I am not sure of WPF support within other IDEs.

Unfortunately this repository does not have *any* unit tests, so you will have to test for regressions manually.
Please be mindful of the users of this application, and thoroughly test any functionality for breaking changes.
